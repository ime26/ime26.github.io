<div id="hello">A little something about me...</div> 
<p>
I have co-produced the Spanish news station of UMTV, UniMiami, written pieces for The Hurricane, Distraction magazine, was editor for the lifestyle section of an online student publication, The Rival and have anchored for UMTV's Newsbreak, Newsvision, and UniMiami. I also have a background in acting, but have found a passion in story telling and informing through journalism as well as photography and videography.
